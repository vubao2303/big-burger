# big-burger
You are in for a treat! It is Covid-season so our speak-easy-kissing booth is hiding as a burger shop. Using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM to create a Kissing Booth app where you can add a name of someone you want to kiss, kiss that person again, or delete that person out of the list after you are done kissing them.

## Description of Page Building 
* Install dependencies packages using npm install, which inclues express, mysql, express-handlebars
* Create folders. Make sure to export modules so files can be used in different places.   
* In datase folder, create table with id, name, and boolean value.
* In config folder, add connection and orm files. Connection file sets up MySQL connection; orm file contains helper functions for SQL syntax.
* Burger.js file in models folder then import the ORM to create functions that will interact with the database.
* Controler file import the model to use its database functions. It creates all our routes and set up logic within those routes where required.


* Public folder
  <ul> 
  <li> Contain javasctip file which activates buttons and send request as well as reload the page to update user input 
  <li> Css file to decorate the page 
  <li> Image file with all the images for background and interface 
  </li>
  </ul>


* Views folder has all the handlebars files, which is the interface of the webstie 

* Server.js file 
  <ul> 
  <li> Serve static content for the app from the "public" directory in the application directory.
  <li> Set Handlebars.
  <li> Parse application body as JSON
  <li>Import routes and give the server access to them.
  <li> Start our server so that it can begin listening to client requests.
  </li>
  </ul>



## Code Snippet
Install npm package: express, mysql, express-handlebars

Required variables 
``` Javascript
var mysql = require("mysql");
var connection = require(`../config/connection.js`);
var express = require(`express`);
var router = express.Router();
var orm = require(`../config/orm.js`);
var PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080;
var app = express();
```

Sets up the Express app to handle data parsing
``` Javascript
app.use(express.static("public"));
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.json());
app.engine("handlebars", exphbs({ defaultLayout: "main" }));
app.set("view engine", "handlebars");
```

Set routes to handle when user "visit" the page 
``` Javascript
router.get(`/`, (req, res) => {
  burger.all(data => {
    var hbsObject = {
      burger: data
    };
    res.render(`index`, hbsObject);
  });
});

router.post(`/api/burgers`, (req, res) => {
  burger.create([`burger_name`], [req.body.name], result => {
    res.json({ id: result.insertId });
  });
});

```
Add orm object to create helper functions for SQL syntax
``` Javascript
var orm = {
  selectAll(tableInput, cb) {
    var queryString = `SELECT * FROM ${ tableInput };`;
    connection.query(queryString, (err, result) => {
      if (err) {
        throw err;
      }
      cb(result);
    });
  },
```

Make Connecion with database 
``` Javascript 
var connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: "localhost",
  port: 3306,
  user: "root",
  password: "password",
  database: "burgers_db"
});
```
